# Performance analysis of the Free particle on the Quantum Joule Brayton engine

Using the libraries such as 'numpy for numerical operations, matplotlib for plotting, and sympy for symbolic mathematics, we observed the results obtained in then plotted the graph.

There are certain parts of the code that could could be advanced and worked on such as the accuracy of the 'diff' function under the sympy library

# Acknowledgement
This was derived from the previous code written in matlab [Documentation](https://github.com/Bukson01/Performance_analysis_of_the_FreeParticle_on_the_Joule-Brayton_Quantum_Like_Engine) and then it is integrated into the Python to access it from  a user friendly language.
